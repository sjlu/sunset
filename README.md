Just a bunch of things that I tend to write over and over again to get a project started. As a
forewarning, this is highly opinionated and is structured to best practices I deem fit.

The project includes the following:

* Express routing structure
* Sequelize and MySQL
* Angular app compiled with Gulp
* Twitter bootstrap
* Worker
* Deployable
* Test structure
